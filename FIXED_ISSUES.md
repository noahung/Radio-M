# RadioM App - Fixed Issues (Updated)

This document summarizes all the fixes made to the RadioM app to resolve the identified issues.

## Splash Screen
- **Issue**: Black blank screen instead of the splash animation
- **Fix**: 
  - Improved splash screen preloading in `app/_layout.tsx`
  - Added better logging and error handling
  - Used `Asset.loadAsync` to properly preload the splash GIF
  - Added fade animation for smoother transition
  - Updated Android styles.xml to use a simpler splash screen approach
  - Added the app icon as a static splash screen logo

## Google Sign-In
- **Issue**: "DEVELOPER_ERROR" when trying to sign in with Google
- **Fix**:
  - Simplified Google Sign-In configuration in `app/services/AuthService.prod.tsx`
  - Disabled `offlineAccess` to avoid token refresh issues
  - Added a custom type interface for proper TypeScript type handling
  - Improved error logging with detailed information
  - Fixed the response parsing to correctly extract user data

## Continue as Guest Button
- **Issue**: Button navigating to a non-existent screen
- **Fix**:
  - Updated the `handleGuestLogin` function in `app/(auth)/login.tsx`
  - Changed navigation path from '/(tabs)' to '/(tabs)/home'
  - Removed additional unnecessary state updates
  - Simplified the guest login flow

## UI Improvements
- **Issue**: Google sign-in button looking off on the Sign Up page
- **Fix**:
  - Made the button smaller and more compact
  - Changed text from "Continue with Google" to just "Google"
  - Updated styling for better appearance
  - Made the same changes on both Login and Sign Up screens for consistency

## Building and Testing

We've created several scripts to help build and test the app:

1. **fix-radinom.ps1**: A simple script that:
   - Copies the Google services file to the correct location
   - Updates the splash screen resources
   - Runs expo prebuild to prepare the app

2. **prepare-android-studio.ps1**: A script that prepares the app for building with Android Studio.

3. **build-production.ps1**: A comprehensive build script for production releases.

## Testing Instructions

After building and installing the app:

1. **Splash Screen**: Verify the splash screen shows properly for about 3 seconds
2. **Google Sign-In**: Test signing in with Google - should no longer show DEVELOPER_ERROR
3. **Guest Login**: The "Continue as Guest" button should now navigate directly to the home tab
4. **Email Sign-In**: Test creating an account and signing in with email and password

## Android Studio Build Instructions

To build the app using Android Studio:

1. Make sure you have copied the `google-services.json` file to `android/app/google-services.json`
2. Open the Android Studio project from the `android` folder
3. In Android Studio, go to Build â†’ Generate Signed Bundle/APK
4. Select APK and click Next
5. Create a new keystore or use an existing one
6. Fill in the key details and click Next
7. Select release build variant and click Finish

## Known Issues and Workarounds

1. **Missing splash screen resources**: Added required drawable resources.
2. **Google Services configuration**: Ensure `google-services.json` is properly placed in the Android project.
3. **React Navigation TypeScript errors**: Added type assertions to handle router navigation issues.

## Testing

After building and installing the APK:
1. Verify splash screen animation displays properly
2. Test guest login navigation
3. Test Google sign-in functionality
4. Test email/password sign-in
